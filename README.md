Yet another Raft consensus implementation

The core algorithm is implemented based on the TLA+ spec, whose safety and liveness are proven.

## Supported Features,
- [x] Core Algorithm, safety, liveness are proven
- [x] Configuration Change Support, add or remove servers one by one without limitation
- [x] Client Request Support, to be enhanced, but is working now.
- [x] **Urgent commit**, see below
- [x] log compaction 

> Urgent Commit, is a new feature introduced by this implementation, which enables the leader asks all other servers to commit one or more logs if commit index is advanced

## About this implementation
it's always safer to implement such kind of algorithm based on Math description other than natural languge description.
there should be an auto conversion from TLA+ to programming languages, even they are talking things in different ways, but they are identical
